# Puriconne TL Overflow Converter 

A Discord bot that converts a TL to match your overflow time. 

For example: For a 50 seconds overflow time, a
1:15 SET ALL 
    Becomes
0:35 SET ALL


### How To Use

Use the slash command by typing "/ovf-tl". There will be two options you must enter: the first is the overflow time in seconds (ex: if you have 1:15 overflow, then enter "75"), and the second is the TL. The TL time format must be in either X:XX or 0X:XX 
(ex: 1:15 or 01:15).
